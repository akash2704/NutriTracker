**Prompt:**

Create a modern, professional logo for "NutriTracker" - an Indian nutrition and fitness tracking web application. 

**Design Requirements:**
- **Name**: NutriTracker
- **Style**: Modern, clean, minimalist
- **Colors**: Use a health-focused color palette (greens, blues, or orange accents)
- **Elements to include**: 
  - A subtle food/nutrition symbol (like a leaf, apple, or plate)
  - A tracking/analytics element (like a chart, graph, or target)
  - Indian cultural touch (optional: subtle spice/grain motif)

**Logo Variations Needed:**
1. **Primary Logo**: Full name with icon (horizontal layout)
2. **Icon Only**: Just the symbol for app icons and favicons
3. **Wordmark**: Text-only version for headers

**Technical Specs:**
- Vector-style design (clean lines, scalable)
- Works well on both light and dark backgrounds
- Readable at small sizes (16px for favicon)
- Professional enough for a health/fitness platform

**Inspiration**: Think of brands like MyFitnessPal, Fitbit, or Healthify but with an Indian touch. The logo should convey trust, health, technology, and nutrition tracking.

**Avoid**: 
- Overly complex designs
- Too many colors
- Cartoon-style illustrations
- Generic fitness symbols (dumbbells, etc.)

Please create 3-4 different logo concepts with variations in layout and color schemes.
